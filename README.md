# LittleModeBook
My first Xamarin.Android App

# What does this app do? 
This application displays information regarding musical theory through the following:
1. The use of an Array of "Scale" objects that display a name, description and "mood picture" for each musical scale.
2. Plays an example of each scale listed in the application via the MediaPlayer class (using Mp3 files). 
3. Has a link to this GitHub web-page (the main page).

# What does this project demonstrate?
This project demonstrates my use of layout concepts within Android, as well as Object Oriented principles. 
The project is useful for those who wish to have a quick repository of musical scales.

# How to get started?
Simply navigate through to the Scales and Modes section to learn about each mode and scale listed in the application. 
Once you are in the Scales and Modes section of the app, tap on a list item to open a list item up. 
You are able to navigate between the screens (activities) using the "Back" buttons around the app. 
If you wish to listen to an example of a scale, go to the Media Player page (from the home page) and tap on a list item. 
You will be able to click "Play" to listen to the scale you have selected. 
If you wish to visit the Github for this page via the application, click on the "About the App" section from the home page and click the button to take yourself to this web page from the app. 

# Layouts
The app will work safely in both landscape and portrait mode on mobile devices. 

# Licensing
Licenses are stated within the licenses.txt file, and cover all media licensing within the app. 

# Versioning
Any files ending in OLD within the main repository on this page are no longer in use within the app; all current files do not have the word OLD in the name. 

# Link to app file on Google Drive
